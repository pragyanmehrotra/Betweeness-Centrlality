# Betweeness-Centrlality
Given a graph the program calculates the betweeness centrality of each node and returns the top k nodes


In graph theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality identify the most important vertices within a graph. Applications include identifying the most influential person(s) in a social network, key infrastructure nodes in the Internet or urban networks, and super-spreaders of disease. Centrality concepts were first developed in social network analysis, and many of the terms used to measure centrality reflect their sociological origin. They should not be confused with node influence metrics, which seek to quantify the influence of every node in the network. 


# Setup

clone the repository 

`git clone https://github.com/pragyanmehrotra/Betweeness-Centrlality.git`

the code has no external dependencies although make sure to edit the code accordingly in order to make it so to take your custom graph as input otherwise the code will work on the default values provided in it and feel free to remove any debugging statements as necessary.

`python betweenessCentrality.py`
